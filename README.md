# Neuro

This is an experimental neural network currently suited to creating a [multilayer perceptron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) with one hidden layer.  

Currently it is not very robust and I am in the process of adding some more generality and functionality so that it can be used in real applications (_Not reccomended_).

Included in the repo is `main.rb` which contains a very basic example program which can be used to test the MLP.  To run the example, you must first
```bundle install```
to install the gems in the Gemfile, and then the program can be executed with
```bundle exec ruby main.rb```

Note that as of this writing the only gem included is `pry` which is used to add breakpoints for debugging purposes.  If you don't wish to use this gem, simply comment out that line before you `bundle install`
